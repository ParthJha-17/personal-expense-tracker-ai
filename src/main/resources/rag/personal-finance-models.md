# Personal finance models and goal mapping

## 50/30/20 budgeting
Best for: stable income, foundational budgeting, and simple guardrails.
Guidance: allocate ~50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt.
Goal mapping: supports general savings goals, emergency fund building, and balanced spending.

## 60/20/20 budgeting
Best for: high-cost-of-living areas or households with heavier fixed costs.
Guidance: 60% needs, 20% wants, 20% savings/debt.
Goal mapping: reduces guilt on essentials while preserving a savings lane.

## Zero-based budgeting
Best for: detailed planners who want every dollar assigned.
Guidance: income minus expenses equals zero; every dollar has a job.
Goal mapping: aligns well with short-term targets, cash flow stability, and cutting overspending.

## Pay-yourself-first
Best for: automating savings and long-term goals.
Guidance: automate transfers to savings/investments before discretionary spending.
Goal mapping: retirement, down payment, emergency funds, and long-term wealth.

## Debt snowball
Best for: motivation and quick wins on multiple debts.
Guidance: pay minimums on all debt, attack the smallest balance first.
Goal mapping: debt elimination with behavioral reinforcement.

## Debt avalanche
Best for: minimizing total interest paid.
Guidance: pay minimums on all debt, attack the highest interest rate first.
Goal mapping: debt elimination with optimal cost efficiency.

## Emergency fund laddering
Best for: households with variable income or job risk.
Guidance: build 1 month, then 3 months, then 6 months of expenses.
Goal mapping: resilience and stability before investing aggressively.

## Sinking funds
Best for: planned irregular expenses (insurance, travel, tuition).
Guidance: set aside small amounts monthly into targeted buckets.
Goal mapping: reduce surprise expenses and avoid debt.

## Investment priority stack
Best for: building long-term wealth after stability.
Guidance: emergency fund → employer match → high-interest debt → IRA → taxable investing.
Goal mapping: retirement readiness and long-term growth.

## Goal-based budgeting
Best for: multiple competing priorities.
Guidance: allocate savings lanes for each goal with timelines and milestones.
Goal mapping: short-, medium-, and long-term goals aligned with cash flow.
